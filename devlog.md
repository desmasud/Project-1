## what do I know
There will be three separate program that works togethe:
    - logger: logs all activity
    - Encryption: Encrypting and decrypting of string
    - driver: the main program that facilitate the interaction of the other two programm. It serves as an OS.

## My overal plan
    - use Java as my main language
    - search how to use process class in Java
    - learn how to encrypt and decrypt string in java
    - research how inter-process communication work and how to develop an app that serve as a driver that facilitate it.
## Today I will work on logger program
    - It will write log messege and write it to log file
    - It will start from the non-white char
    - It will accept message from a command line by entering the name of the log file.
    - It will work Until it recieves 'QUIT'.
